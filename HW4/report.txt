0. There are two methods for building a heap from an unsorted array:
   (1) insert each element into the heap  --- O(nlogn)
   (2) heapify (top-down)                 --- O(n)

   (a) (theoretically) Derive their time complexities.
   (b) (empirically)   Use a long list of random numbers to show the difference in time.
       		       What about sorted or reversely-sorted numbers?

   Write your answers to (a) and (b) in report.txt.

1. 

   Q: What are the time complexities of these algorithms? 



2. k-way mergesort (the classical mergesort is a special case where k=2).


   Q: What is the complexity? Write down the detailed analysis in report.txt.
	k(logk)
