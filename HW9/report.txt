1.
the time complexities is O(n + k), because we have n node and k edge. So when we add the k edge the time complexities is O(k) and when we go though the n node the time complexities is O(n), So the total time complexities is O(n + k)
and  the space complexities should be O(n + k)
2.
For program 2, we do topological sort at first. So this part's time complexities is O(n + k). And the second part,
and the space complexities is O(n + k + n^2) = O(n^2)
3.
In this question, we can know the time complexities Oï¼ˆn^2).
and the space complexities is O(n^2)
