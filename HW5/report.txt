0. Compare two recursive implementations of fib (naive vs. memoized).
   (a) What's exact complexity of naive in theory?
   (b) Let's say you know it's O(a^n); can you curve-fit to determine the approximate value of a?
   (c) Does this value match the theoretical complexity?
   (a)	O(2^n)
   (b)	2
   (c)	all most
1.What's the complexity?
	max_wis	O(n)
	max_wis2 O(n)
2.What's the complexity of this DP?
	O(n)
  What's the name of this famous number series?
	Catalan Number
